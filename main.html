    <b>About me</b><br>
    First of all, I love programming, I love to learn and discover new things,  
    and now I'm trying to develop my skills. I don't have a lot of friends,  
    but those I do have are my best friends, I want to become  
    full-stack developer.<br>
    <b> My throughts</b><br> I like to train body, to train mind, to always be fit, but i
    know that you can't be ideal everywhere, that's why i am trying to make balance
    in every side. 2-3 years ago i was motivated to become the best in my way, i was succeed
    in that time, but later was like in the water, couldn't do anything. It felt like climbing the steps
    to upper levels. Right now something is interferes. But i know that i shouldn't give up.<br>
    <b>Why did i choose AITU</b><br>
    Why did i choose this university, it's because for me it was something that i couldn't afford,
    i mean, being in the school where nobody wants to succeed, be in another level, so aitu was.
    And also opportunities, friends, vibe that gives this university is the best. There you can
    become the most social person, if you wasn't, you can have real friends forever. You can feel 
    true emotions, while celebrating something. And this is only social part, about other parts it's 
    way more cool. But still, i would like to climb the steps way more higher.
